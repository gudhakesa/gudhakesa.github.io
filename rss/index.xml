<p>One of the questions frequently asked by friends and colleagues about qualitative research is always about what is it that I actually do. I often say to them that qualitative research is about understanding human experiences, and understanding the objects or things related to building human experience. Confused? I&#8217;ll give you some examples then. I&#8217;ll tell you a story on how I approach or dissect human experiences. Especially experiences on product consumption.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Qualitative research, as a tool for developing marketing strategies aren&#8217;t a new thing. It&#8217;s been done since the mid 20th century by advertising agencies, consumer goods manufacturer, or service providers. And understanding the approach of qualitative, in my opinion, could be the best thing to help you develop your business, especially if your business deal a lot with the everyday consumers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I talked with many small business owners, and they often ask me for quick advice on how to make sure products deliver the best human experience. This is what I often tell them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Basically, we all have stories to tell. We buy things, we use things, we consume things like snacks and ice cream because we want to have an experience. Experience itself is a very broad term. It doesn&#8217;t always talk about the good taste of the food you eat, it doesn&#8217;t talk about the good texture, it doesn&#8217;t talk about how good looking a fashion item you buy, and so on. Experiences are mostly about what kind of stories you want to feel for yourself while using or consuming a product.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, let&#8217;s talk about a hypothetical consumer named Bob. Bob likes to eat potato chips. And me, as a qualitative researcher, or maybe people from frito-lay wants to understand more on why bob likes potato chips. It&#8217;s often not enough to ask Bob about why does he like potato chips. A rationalized answer is the only think we probably get from Bob if we ask him that way. The right way to ask is actually "What is the significance of potato chips in Bob&#8217;s life / daily routines / experience?".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This approach is very important when qualitative researchers are faced with a consumer reality. When we are asked, why do people consume the things they consume, it will take us deeper than having to ask Bob, why does he consume potato chips, for instance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The best way to deal with this problem is through narratives. Narratives is an approach in which we believe that people always have a main theme in consuming something. Take a look at this childishly-drawn sets of boxes below:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="http://gudhakesa.com/images/qual/connar.PNG" alt="connar.PNG">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are the things we should figure out every time we try to understand why Bob likes potato chips. We could start our journey by putting our attention to the green box (Settings / time / occasions / scenes). We could start asking Bob on what occasions does he eat potato chips.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then we can move to the blue box (audiences). Who are there with him when he eats potato chips? On the grey box, we&#8217;ll ask bob, what would he feel if on that certain occasion with friends (or alone), he&#8217;s out of potato chips? What is the function of that particular potato chips ON that setting?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, let&#8217;s move backwards to the Yellow box (Product role / attributes). We could now ask Bob, what is it about the potato chips that you enjoy, ON THAT CERTAIN OCCASION? If bob like to eat potato chips while watching the NFL night with friends, what is the allure of a bowl of potato chips? Why not ice cream instead?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, to get to the red box, we can construct a comprehensive story on what role do potato chips play in bob&#8217;s routine. And what are the feelings Bob want to attain in the companion of Frito-lay&#8217;s potato chips? Constant observing and asking about potato chips with the narrative approach could give us a holistic view, of the significance of potato chips in Bob&#8217;s life. In short, we could now understand deeply on the role of potato chips in building the experience Bob wanted. I illustrated the results below:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="http://gudhakesa.com/images/qual/connar2.PNG" alt="connar2.PNG">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Applied to other product categories, or services, this approach is useful to understand reasons on why people consumes the thing they consume. It&#8217;s also a way to understand why people behave like they do. This is a very simple explanation I often give to people around me about what does a qualitative researcher does, in context of business and marketing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I believe that this approach is not exclusively a qual researcher&#8217;s to own. Laypeople could also adopt this approach in building experiences they desire. To make full use of the narrative approach, there are a few things that a people have to keep in mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>First, let go of all judgement and bias</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Well, in order to be successful in dissecting somebody&#8217;s subjective experience is to understand that they are NOT you. They experience, perceive, and make sense of the world (and things) differently than your own. What is logical for you in making a decision, could possibly not be a logical decision at all for other people. This is very important to keep in mind before you start your observation and analysis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re a product developer, understand that there are ways that people will use your product, and it could be a whole lot different than the first time you designed the product for. if you&#8217;re a chef or a cook, understand that not everybody have the same approach to taste and textures the way you have been educated. Understanding this, will be the first step on creating the most meaningful experience for your customers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Secondly, don&#8217;t take your consumers answers in face value</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consumers don&#8217;t say what they mean, and they don&#8217;t mean what they say. They don&#8217;t think deep enough when asked about why they like to consume / buy things. So keep challenging them. Ask them further. Throw them additional "why", confirm, and reconfirm. Be prepared that whatever they say might only applicable in certain settings, or conditions. Be open, and explore deeper into their experience. You&#8217;ll unlock things you could probably never knew existed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Lastly, Observe! Observe! Observe!</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Words can mislead. Answers may lie. But the power of observation goes way beyond. Observe deeper on the way your customers deal with things, or deal with his / her world. Be sensitive to notice the things they do that you don&#8217;t normally do, or vice versa. Be in the present, and keep your eyes open for habits or actions previously unknown to you. You will be able to understand his / her experience a little better.</p>

<p>Writing now has become an unfashionable craft. In midst of vlogs and podcasts, the art of making a point through threaded letters and well-crafted diction is diminishing. At least that’s the way I see it.
We live in times when we’re obsessed to get our points across to our audiences as fast as possible. Our point of view should be conversational, and as succinct as a 30-seconds pitch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While there’s nothing wrong with it, I still long for a writing culture in which it emphasize more on the power of words. To write is to impose tone and manner without the help of facial expression and audible emphasis. This is the craft I’d like to submit my devotion to at the moment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am always drawn to books and ideas. From classical writers to contemporary philosophy. Though letters, words, and writings will never cease to exist in our world, it is important for us to give more attention and discipline to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the hardest thing in doing so, is to find your own voice. A constant, unchanging point of view, tone, manner, that could narrate a blank sheet of paper, or a blank white LCD screen. Finding your own voice could be a never-ending journey. It may take a lifetime. But I’d like to share some quick tips on how to find your own voice, and start your journey to the craft of writing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Write more, write often</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most important thing for me to start this journey, is to write more and write often. Writing is not an overnight mastery. It took many hours, days, or years of constant dialogue with your inner self. Writing is not a virtue, it’s merely a habit.
There are no better advice I could share to people wanting to start to write, other than: write.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Be Self Aware, Constantly</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I remember once I could write more than 4 pieces a night. There are more times I remember having difficulties to write a piece in 4 months. I call it the low days and the high days. When it happens, accept it. But also try to understand why it’s happening to you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ask yourself questions. Have you dedicate enough time to have a dialogue with yourself? Have you take enough time to actually sit still, and think about the things you’ve been through? Have you dedicate a little more time to make yourself comfortable with a pen and a notebook? Or a distraction-free writing app beside netflix?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Low days and high days happen only because we decided (both intendedly or unintendedly) to put our focus on the things that surround us. It took a certain degree of self awareness to actually realize whether the things we give attention to, on a certain time period, will be beneficial in developing your writing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Lastly, put your inspirations down</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In times of endless reference and inspiration, it’s always easy to get immersed in hours of book reading, blog reviewing, or youtube watching. We live in time where millions of good (and also bad) literature pop in front of our eyes wanting to inspire, or simply be seen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Inspirations are good, but also acknowledge the fact that it consumes your attention. And your attention is the only thing that’s keeping you away from that blank page.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A good book, or a good inspiration, also need to be put down. Because in the end, it silences your own voice. And your voice is the only thing that matter in your journey of writing, or word-crafting.</p>

<p>With myself belonging in the millennial generation, it&#8217;s always interesting for me to observe my own generation. It&#8217;s one of the ways I reflect back at myself, my decisions, and my view of life. And being involved in qualitative research often give me a profoundly general point of view in explaining my generation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What makes a millennial different compared to previous generations is the fact that we grew up with the internet. We millennials remember making our first email addresses, from services that are probably obsolete by now. We all experienced lifestyle changes through internet and technology, through gadgets and gizmos. Global connectivity is the excalibur to the modern day king Arthur, and I guess we&#8217;re the first generation who democratizes its full power.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They way internet is changing our lives is by giving us two things. One, is the democratization of knowledge, and secondly is the disruption of our social conduct. Internet had enabled us to access information previously limited to certain cultures or countries. The birth of knowledge without boundaries had made us more critical than ever before. This of course, would affect how we live our social lives today. The way we interact with people is different compared to the young people in the 80s. We spend most of our times with friends, with our eyes glued to smarthphone screens. We could have lively discussions and chats without any lip movements, just a few tap of the thumbs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, these democratization of knowledge, and disruption of social conduct. What do they bring us? Those things had brought us to a state where we&#8217;re naturally inclined to challenge any status quo or hegemony. We have access to vast amount of information now, so we challenge, we ponder, we tweak, we hack, and we question endlessly. Now that sounds like a millennial to me.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are no generation that have the drive to challenge the hegemony as hard as the millennials. This is due to the fact that the internet penetration among the global citizen is exponentially faster compared to other technological advancement.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So most of millennials now have that call to change or challenge things. It&#8217;s more common for us millennials to argue with our parents or our teachers. We challenge institutions more openly, and we go as far as we can imagine. The conflict resolution between parents and millennial children had evolved into something unimaginable in previous times.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The question now is how do millennials cope or deal with that call to change and to challenge? Bearing that question in mind, here are the five types of millenials.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>The Straight Trajectories</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are the millennials who live their lives as if they&#8217;re living a straight line. The main key of living life for these straights are living life on repeat. They like to repeat success stories that are told to them, and live life accordingly. If my parents are lawyers, I&#8217;d get myself into law school too, because I know that being a lawyer is promising. If my parents say that working in a multinational company would benefit me, I&#8217;d do it. These millennials simply doesn&#8217;t embrace the true calling of being a millennial. They usually live their lives through the eyes and values of the previous generations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Their simplistic, or somewhat naive approach to life is actually something we should give respect to. We have known that it&#8217;s harder than ever to keep life on track with different realities of modern days economy. These type of millennials work their way through career choices with ease and seamlessly. They&#8217;re the ones who had decided their direction of life before life even happens for them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>The Anarchist</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A polar example compared to the previous, this type of millennials focus their life on fighting against the current norm or hegemony. If society expect me to live in a certain way, the way I&#8217;m going to do it is act the other way around. If the way to live means having to indulge myself in a 9-to-5 jobs, to hell with it. These millennials will refuse to be bound by any rules or social conduct. They challenge everything in search for a better form of life. They embrace the call to change and challenge as their way of life.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Despite the anarchist nature of these types, they&#8217;re actually the most exposed to life experiments and opportunities. They are the first kind to create new things and able to make things happen. They make businesses happen, or making social impact heard. A lot of social revolution in world&#8217;s history came from these people unbound to rules and boundaries. There are huge probability that the next best thing in the world, comes from these type of millennials.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>The Compromiser</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If life is like a circus act, then life for these millennials are like balancing a tightrope. They&#8217;re mainly focused on keeping balance between their inner calling as millennials, and maintaining society&#8217;s standard and expectation. A life form mostly found in emerging Southeast-Asian countries like Malaysia and Indonesia, but we might find these types lurking in most progressive cities of the world. These types often find themselves compromising their dreams in order to please certain social practices. These millennials see compromise as a way out. A balanced and proactive approach to life, with goals to please as many lives as possible; starting with their life, and other people that surrounds them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But it&#8217;s not entirely bad. One of the things we should appreciate from these type of millennials is their ability to manage multiple goals at once. They could be having a prestigious job in an international company, while also making businesses on the side. They&#8217;re the ones who is dying to change their way of life, while also being respectful to social norms and values.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>The Disconnected</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A special case within millennials, these types resembles what most people remember being the punk-rock or emo kids in the early 2000s. These type of millennials usually have clear direction on where they want to go, but they don&#8217;t show it to others. They have this calling to challenge or to change, but they don&#8217;t preach about it. However, compliance to current society&#8217;s standard also not in their agenda. To most, they would seem like lost people. They tend to be reserved individuals to most.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, not everything is grim about these millennials. What we can learn from them are the willpower and endurance they had shown throughout their adolescent life. Though self-reserved, these types had proven to be the people who think and feel deeply. They face adversities in the most enduring way possible. Their perception towards life are inevitably useful and inspirational for other people in getting through life. Their story of perseverance and enduring life could prove to be meaningful for all of us.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>The Artist</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last type of millennials, I often like to call the lucky ones. These are the rare types that usually made the world go round in their own orbit, effortlessly. The ones that have the calling to change and challenge, yet the world is conspiring with them in creating the changes they want to happen. These type of millennials usually doesn&#8217;t have much external factors to fight against in making their dreams happen. They simply have to be stubborn enough to do the things they love.  Things are provided, or easily come to their way. Their main challenge is self-reflective, and all about overcoming one&#8217;s own demon.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The way that they&#8217;re lucky, is because they usually could dedicate themselves fully on their road to self-development. They could be wanting different things compared to other people, yet the world gives them just that. They could be wanting to indulge their lives fully on the road to artistry and creation, or simply to have a job that society doesn&#8217;t want to have, yet they can do it with ease. For example, a son of a banker and investment broker who wanted to be a writer and scholar, and he worked his way through it with ease.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the end, there are no types of millennials better than the other. Eventually our own adversities and challenges shapes us the way we are today. And it&#8217;s no use for us to regret the things that happened to us in the past. Our challenges and calling only will shape our decisions the way it suits us. It&#8217;s important for us to understand well, which types do we belong to, to question ourselves, to reflect back on what made us into the millennials we are today. Eventually we&#8217;re required to combine forces together, shaping our world the way we envision it to be.</p>

<p>I remember a few months ago, when I attended a workshop on drawing and painting. it was an open event, commissioned by local artists and painters for the general public. The main goal of the event is to introduce the fundamentals of drawing to the general public. The initiator of the events, the artists, believe strongly that anyone can draw, and it only takes a few correct approach to drawing to unleash the hidden talent in all of us.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So they first open the workshop, telling us to draw a bowl of fruits in front of the room. And so I did. Of course I failed miserably. All I left on the piece of paper was a bunch of poorly-drawn bananas and oranges with incorrect order and shades.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I was later told that, the key for a successful, life-like drawings are when we perceive the object we&#8217;d like to draw just as it is, not as we thought it should be. I was dumbfounded at first, trying to make sense of whatever it is I have been told.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But later on I got the point. My failure to draw is because I constructed bananas and oranges the way I remembered how bananas and oranges are shaped. I didn&#8217;t draw my bananas and oranges the way it is as presented in the bowl in front of me. I linger more on the shape of hundreds of bananas and oranges' I&#8217;ve seen, rather than the actual shape of the bananas and oranges in front of me.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In my work as a qual researcher, I often got annoyed with a problem of not being able to understand why do people behave like they do. Why do people would use bing instead of google? Why do people like to eat tempe instead of tahu? It was always later I realized, the reason I am not able to understand them, is because I was actually asking: why don&#8217;t people behave like I do? If I am able to perceive the way people live the way they are, also with their realities and contexts, I would not have the same annoyance. I would make research reports better and faster and also made more sense.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These series of things, which taught us to perceive things the way they actually are, in contrast to how we constructed the things based on our experience and memories, play a very important role in how we approach life. In specific, it taught us to deal with a happy life.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The key for a happy life is when we could perceive life as it is in front of us, not based on our constructed ideals and memories about the things that made us happy. Our previous excitements, memories, and experiences are constantly building aspirations and longings in the back of our head. These images and aspirations stays there, clouding our vision to really see life the way it is actually presented in front of our eyes. We fail to see a good life, because what we do is actually compare and contrast our current context with a previous reality that is obsolete.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is impossible to understand life as comprehensive as we might hoped, if we keep lingering on the good memories we had. Good things in the past happens because of the past&#8217;s context and reality. What we consider good in the past, could not possibly be as good if we experience it now, because we&#8217;re facing a different reality. We often seek happiness in life the way we expect a perfect deja vu moment of our previous exhilaration. While we all no, there is never a perfect deja vu moment in life.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That is why, I think we should learn from artists, painters, photographers, or qual researchers. We should always be reminded that great beauty, or great reality, are always represented when we learn to be in the present. When we draw, copy, capture, or describe the current experience the way it is actually presented in front of us.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In times of anxiety and anxiousness. It&#8217;s worth trying to get a bunch of bananas and oranges on a bowl, and try to draw it. Remember that we need to approach our current reality the way we draw the perfect bananas and oranges. By really making sense of what it really looks like in front of our eyes. Not by comparing them to previous bananas and oranges, and not by worrying about what our future bananas will look like.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Have a banana!</p>

<p>My dream to be a writer, or at least to constantly write, is actually a recent aspiration. I have developed my love for writing in my late university years. I remember it was my only way to express a late-teenage angst, and then the habit stick.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I love writing the way it function like an emotional outlet. Like a faucet for my overflowing emotions, thoughts and ideas. Writing is like taking my daily dose of drugs. Like an amphetamine, it helps me focus and lost at the same time. It keeps my mind afloat, yet my feet on the ground.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am of course, lately in deep disappointment. Seeing my own writings to be not as productive as I hoped to be. And I kept wondering why, and how could this happen. So I contemplate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Writing is like one important tool for one&#8217;s linguistic mastery. And linguistic mastery, for me, isn’t about communication per se. It’s about a discipline of thought. The way you manage your logic is detrimental to how you use language, and what language do you use.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am, by default, a bilingual. In one side, I enrich my knowledge with English books and literature, yet I must function properly in most aspect of my life using my mother tongue. To some extent, I could feel the mastery of both language conflicts inside my head. And the conflict isn’t about diction or vocabulary, but more about point of views. The two language seem to have a polar thought structure. One rich in expression, the other functional. One heavy on analogy, the other rich in vocabulary. I often found myself confused and simply brain dead trying to retrieve words or threading sentences into a paragraph. Not only in writing, but also on verbal occasions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I remember a research that mention human can’t really do, or focus at two things at one time. When it comes to the use of language, it does make sense. One can’t simply think and speak in two languages with different roots. Some people can speak english, while mixing up with a little french and Spanish. That’s understandable because those languages have the same root: Latin. The words different, the grammar different, but I can argue that all of those language share the same structure and discipline of thought. It was conceived out of cultures with many shared values.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I realised that maybe the fact that I’m stuck between two languages is the main barrier for my unproductive writing habit. I can’t seem to pinpoint words to use, or even usable expressions. I can’t decide clearly on how to narrate or describe a particular tone and point of views. I feel like my thoughts are caught in the middle.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I miss the moments where I could remember words flowing out of my fingertips seamlessly, faster than my tongue muster a syllable. I do miss the fluidity of words that runs in the back of my head each time I’m engage in a certain topic. It’s just that, now it isn’t happening. Or at least it’s not happening as often as I hoped it should.</p>

<p>One Afternoon, in Ngurah Rai Int&#8217;l Airport</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we feel that we long for a significant other, or when we say we’re in love with a particular person, it is often a very revealing moment for ourselves. Often times, our attraction stems from appreciation of an idea, or attributes about them in which we are lacking. Our romantic tendency to long for someone are mostly based on the feeling of incompleteness we have towards ourselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Appreciation comes easy when we are faced with a person in which their quality excel far greater than we perceived ourselves to be. For example, we could appreciate someone who are good in self-financing, or perhaps very caring and warm. This is because we might be aware that those qualities are the things we do not really have. We might be a little clumsy in our finances, or perhaps we are often awkward and cold to new people. We long to complete ourselves, by finding the pieces we do not have.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Without we realising, our admiration or longing don’t always have to apply to our romantic partner. It could apply to anything. Like when we are longing for a new job, a new career, in deciding where to travel, or a new city to live in. We might be drawn into the beauty of old narrow streets in a European town, its warm afternoon, sidewalk cafes, and the laid-back ambience. We long for that, because we maybe living in a city with not much story of preserved heritage. It’s busy streets are deafening to our ears, the air polluted, and the way people live around us constantly remind us that we’re stuck in a rut.</p>

<p>In my recent travel to Bali, I can remember how I fell in love with everything this island have to offer. I remember how I wish I could spend my days in clean air, good breakfast, and have the view of the ocean in my wake. I thought of how I could take my time slowly and appreciate each day better, by watching the sunset at the end of each day. These are the thing I have been missing in my hometown, and I have developed my longing towards.
It is very easy for me to come into snap judgement and decisions about moving in to Bali. I could embrace a long term relationship with this island, fulfill my longing, fall in love, and commit myself on having my love affair with the beauty of the island.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But then I remember, like two people who are able to fall in love, they are also able to fall out of love. When time does its magic towards our significant other, when it finally reveals them fully to us, we could suddenly, without our knowing think that we chose the wrong person. It is natural that the more we dedicate ourselves into a relationship, we realise we are eventually, irredeemably alone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I finally understood that my longing for this island, are in fact an expression of the things I simply missed back home. There comes a realisation, that possibly, when the island life are fully revealed, it will give me another feeling of loneliness and anxiety. In the wake of my inevitable return from this trip, I have realised that I am anxious to bound back home. But I am just as anxious to imagine myself having to be committed, or in metaphor, to marry this island long term.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I came to this holiday trip, hoping to have a relief for my hometown anxiety. I haven’t got the things I wished for. I even came home with more fear and anxiety. But I also gained something more valuable: To accept the prevalence of anxiety that haunts each and every decisions we will made, and also the understanding of the logic behind our longing.
Like our love life. Love come and go easily. The feeling of longing happens easily only when we are reminded of the things we do not have. In the end, familiarity takes action and longing fades. We will wake up to the same boring reality of a long-term relationship, the duty of household financing, the unattractive prospect of laundry, or the repulsive aspect of our significant other’s character revealed across time. What is unchanged is our commitment to anchor ourselves in the reality (and security) we know will be our consequence to our long-term decision.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just like my recent travel taught me, we have to be aware of the source of our longing. The things we long for might not be easily available nor accessible in one’s hometown, but that never means our dream destination always have everything we need. In the end, it’s important for us to anchor ourselves to the reality (and security) that no matter where we live, no matter where do we decide to stand our feet, the sun rises and sets in the same direction. The sea will always send its love with its waves. The mountains will still be as sublime to our perception.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In short, no matter what the reality surrounds us, we could always anchor ourselves to the reality (and also security) that life continues in its own pace. Not the way we might hoped them to be, but always in its own beautiful, grandiose way.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some summer afternoon, I drove my car into an intersection just in the heart of the city. The light turns red, so I slowed down, shift my gear down to first gear and release the clutch slowly in order to slow the car down. The brakes of the car aren’t something you could put your trust on, and it’s extremely noisy if you force it through. I was on front, just right behind the stop line.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The car doesn’t have any stereo set whatsoever, so the slow purr of the engine was all I can hear for my entertainment. It’s a steady hum-and-shackle just below 1,000 RPM and the occasional hiccups. An occasional surge of fuel surplus going thought the carburettor because of the new additional fuel pump I have to install in order to keep the car running.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the light turns green, I carefully shift to the first gear, and release the clutch. Accelerating was not really an instant effect you could expect. It’s a slow and steady push forward as you heard the engine start purring at higher RPM, and the occasional horn-honking drivers right on your back. You can’t help it. You just have to move along, slow and steady, with the melodies of diminished, high-pitched electrical horn honking at the back of your head.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The acceleration of the car was pretty much slow, with its engine blowing hiccups and mechanical tantrums. Even at top gear, you could only go as fast as 3,000 RPM without having to worry that the whole assembly of the car might just tear down. It never goes faster than 90 km/h, and I don’t think it’s wise to try to go further than that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The overal ride experience was strenuous. The suspension doesn’t work at all, due to its old-and-worn rubber cones on all 4 wheels. One single bump you encounter, could provoke an earthquake right behind the driver’s seat. And the big “thunk” sound of metal-to-metal contact was never a good part of your driving experience.
The car was a perfect, ingenious design back in its time. But then again, after 40 years of constant service, it’s an entirely different story.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve been driving a 1974 Mini Cooper on a daily basis throughout my professional career (my professional career wasn’t that long up until this article is written, though). I could say that this is the first car that I have taken responsibility caring for. I’ve never gotten my hands dirty trying to maintain a car my whole life, until this baby came in to my posession.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The car was undeniably a sight of beautiful assymetry and a satirical approach to imperfection. Ingenious in design, practical, with its heart lies on the foundation of marvelous craftmanship, but it has its limits. Its functionality stripped down comfort, and its simplicity lacks sympathy to its drivers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>But it was through driving this car, I learned a lot to listen, and to sympathise</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The car lacks sympathy, it was the other way around. The car had turned into something that I have to sympathise for if I ever want to drive around with it everyday. Gas-guzzling, engine revving, or excessive speeding weren’t a logical choice for me. I have to sympathise to every worn-out gear and gaskets that 40 years of service had given them. Even a masterpiece often had time to work  against its nature, and I have to understand that. Driving around with the car had made me more sensitive to my senses. It reminds me to pay attention to how the clutch responded to the gentle push of my toes. It taught my ears to listen carefully to any possible out-of-place clunk and thump. Personifying the car to be people I deal with everyday, reminds me that I might have do the same to the people around me. I realised that other people often were bunch of emotional and physiological gears and gaskets too, worn-out by experience and time of their own. It taught me to listen more to their story, and to sympathise more to what they have to say.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>I learned that bumps and obstructions are a given in life. Just be cautious.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bumps and roadblocks aren’t something I could take for granted when driving a car with a worn-out suspension system. I can’t put my foot on the right pedal without having to be sure of any obstruction ahead. The road wasn’t in my favour, and I don’t think it ever will be. The road is beyond what I can control, so I just let it be. The whole experience taught me to be a little more cautious in driving. Maybe that goes the same with life. Roadblocks and detour weren’t really within our controls. Problems and trivia aren’t really within our grasp to make sense of. What’s more important is for you to be cautious of what might lies ahead. I guess it’s more important than ever to cast your eyes about to whatever within your visibility. Be mindful of what lies ahead. You’ll dodge bullets if you’re lucky.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>I learned to slow down, I learned to be small</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think the correct expression to define the experience using an old car is to be “in appreciation of slowness”. It’s a common sight having to drive at the slowest lane and see all cars and trucks overtake you. It’s the same with life, I guess. It’s always a common sight to see other people succeed, thrive, or march forward a little faster than you think you are. It makes me realise, that often it’s pretty much pointless if you have to force yourself up to their pace. You were given your own pace and speed, to do your own thing. And often, the best response you can give to the fast-forwarding people and world around you, is just to slow down, be small, and don’t hurt yourself. It’s not getting ahead that matters. It’s about reaching your destination. It’s not about how fast you’ll get there, it’s more about how you enjoy your time planning the journey. You have the burden (or benefits) of carrying a 40-years-old wisdom right within your palms, and there’s no need of forcing it through the traffic. Be small, slow down, and enjoy the ride.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>I learned about love</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kahlil Gibran once said,</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>“Love is work made visible. And what is it to work with love? It is to weave the cloth with threads drawn from your heart, even as if your beloved were to wear that cloth.”</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I guess this car is a perfect definition of love. My tendency to objectify my love for the car is more than just a blind, testosterone-filled passion. It’s more about realising the true exchange of love. It took inconsiderable amount of time and care to maintain a well-running, old engine on wheels. I learned that for you to get the most out of the whole experience, it took lots of heartfelt care and patience to make sure it’s running flawlessly. What the car gave me in return was also something that was important beyond measure. It’s my means of transportation, a means of keeping my world up and running. And the experience of it all, which has been a thrill, never fail to deliver that triumphant feeling.
Eventually, after all the effort, blood, and endless bath in engine oil, It’s more about realising and understanding the feeling of being loved back. Your efforts are returned, visibly. You feel the result of all the care you put through right in the grasp of your palms, at the touch of our feet. Your patience are paid back in the sweet hum of that 1.000cc engine.
You reap the seeds you sow with your own hands. You get what you give. And for me, that’s the true exchange of love humankind had ever experienced.
I learned to appreciate life (and beauty) a little bit better, and life is more about the journey
What are the perks of having to be slow and small? It’s no other than the chance to catch more of the world’s marvel, beauty, and diversity. It often took me twice as long to get to one place or another compared to other people. But I realised what had not been missing. The thrill, the view, and the sight of the world surround me were always at my pleasure. The journey to a destination had given me a chance to cast my sight around and about, to whatever the world is trying to show me. The joy of the journey often lies just right at the side of the road, and you only can enjoy every marvel of it by paying more attention to what it has to offer. Roadside sight, wasn’t a thing I take for granted anymore.
What are more exciting in life other than to be right here, in the now? The beauty of life isn’t on the end of the road, on top of mountains, or in the very end of your destinations. It was the grassy field you met along the hike. It was all the small lake you stopped by during your first checkpoint. It was the people you met along the way, giving thumbs up, smiled, and laughed with you along your ride. It was the children laughing, cheering your way up, although you’re struggling to put the second gear on the long ascending road.
In slowness, you learn to laugh with your efforts. To make fun of the things you had put your heart on doing, and share the joy with other people along your way.
And I guess those are the things I learned about life, through driving an outdated, 40-years-old engine on wheels. Sometimes, you just gotta pay attention on the little things. But most of the time, you’ll realise that some things just take time. You can’t force things to go your way. You have to live a little of your life along with the bump. You’ll learn that you can’t run all the time. You’ll learn to appreciate slowness, and dwell in it. It taught me to sit back and breathe. Perfection comes with patience and determination. And in the end, no one will deny beauty made with care and time.</p>
