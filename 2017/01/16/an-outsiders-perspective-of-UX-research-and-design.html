<h2 id="_a_little_back_story">A little back story</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I was previously not a person in design, software, tech, or anything related to the tech-startup culture. The term "UX Research" or "UX Design", as much as they become the buzzword of the year, didn&#8217;t come to my attention until the last 12 months. I have spent my entire professional career working in qualitative research, doing research in many field like social research, cultural studies, and more specifically: developing marketing efforts for brands and companies in order to connect better with their consumers. It&#8217;s easy to find my name among the people working in consumer goods companies or business consultants.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What&#8217;s interesting for me is the rising trend of UX (both research and design) discussions in my daily professional lives. Everything UX seem to be in people&#8217;s attention nowadays. Almost every discussion with the people I met revolves around how a tech-startup now focusing on making a robust UX design, how other companies now doing UX research, or now someone we previously knew had become a self-proclaimed UX researcher.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The talk about the disruption of tech-startups in the industry is what fueled the discussions. Many young industry practicioners now talk about their interest and knowledge in the UX field. My continuous work as a qual researcher, also by doing collaboration with tech-startups is the thing that had me exposed to the term "UX". It opened my journey towards understanding more from the world of UX. So the purpose of this piece, will talk a bit about an outsider&#8217;s perspective in doing UX, both about research and design.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_the_idea">The Idea</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From my understanding, the main idea of UX efforts are about integrating technology into our day of life. UX can be seen as an effort to streamline the disruption process of technology in entering the way we do our daily lives. Of course this term is a very broad definition, but let&#8217;s start from there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The discipline of UX, in my opinion, begins at the question of "how will a technology (or product, or service) enter our daily lives, changing the way we do things before we knew that particular technology". The key main role of technology here is to transform our habit, our conduct, and the way we do our usual tasks, no matter how small it is possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our role as UX designers or researchers in the business value chain, then, is to position that particular technology (or product, or services) as our client. And like any client, they have their own goal for us to tackle. It is within our duty to make sure that the road for disruption is well prepared and as smooth as possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>UX designers: We&#8217;re the gatekeepers of innovation and disruption.</em></p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This approach sounds very similar in my line of work as a market researcher and brand builder. It is within my duty to make sure that the brand I work for can disrupt people&#8217;s habit and behavior. It&#8217;s within my scope of work to make sure that brands can understand its target consumers precisely, so that they can really give the consumers a meaningful product and services.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In essence, it is my work to establish a meaningful experience for our target consumers with the product we deliver. I could safely say that the discipline of brand building is interrelated to the discipline of UX.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="__what_is_it_like_to_be_them">"What is it like to be them?"</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My approach in doing UX research comes down to a very simple question. When you have a clear image of your target consumer, the question we should ask ourselves is "what is it like to be them?". Our task as researchers (or designers) eventually is to unearth a worldview in which our consumers / users live in. Not only unearthing those worldviews, we are also obliged to live in them, understanding their way of thinking, what motivates them,, how they live their lives, and eventually, how they are going to react when exposed to our products or services? We are required to be able to "read" people and their genuine reaction towards whatever offer we&#8217;re about to make for them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think this understanding of UX efforts is essential for every doer in the industry. Because I can&#8217;t think more of the things that make a great product other than a product that empathize well with the users. A great product is a product that can create better experience for our users / consumers. The road to empathy itself, lies within our expertise.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, the question I&#8217;m often asked, what are the tools in researching or designing a good UX? For me, I think it comes down to simple storytelling&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_the_importance_of_steinbeck_and_orwell_in_ux">The importance of Steinbeck and Orwell in UX</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For me, there is no more robust tool for a researcher to understand the consumers (or users) other than observation and storytelling.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The essence of being ourselves, our identities, or constellation of values are all embedded in, well, stories. The way we share our worldviews with the world, the way we share our political beliefs, our arguments, our experiences, are all in the form of stories. Stories as one of the main observation points for qualitative researchers, doesn&#8217;t only speak on individual levels, but also at cultural levels. The way societies and civilizations progress are by series of events happening, and retold in stories.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unearthing stories surrounding the lives of the user comes to be a very important part of doing doing UX efforts. It is by making them to tell us their stories, we will be able to dive deep into their beliefs, values, and worldview. To position ourselves as UX researcher / designer, is like positioning ourselves like a documentary maker, a filmmaker, or a writer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Think of John Steinbeck in "Of Mice and Men". Think of how Steinbeck really put up a good narrative in helping us understand the lives and worries of plantation workers, farmers, or ranch workers. Or the best example that I can think of is George Orwell&#8217;s flawless observation and narrative in "Down and Out in Paris &amp; London". Orwell orchestrated a good example of observation and storytelling. He had succeeded in empathizing with waiters and chefs in a Parisian restaurants (or a beggar in London), understanding their motives, worries, and view of life, and retold that story and observation in impeccable narrative. What helped him doing so is the fact that he himself dived deep into the lives of those people (although unwillingly), and opened his eyes into the untold details of the people around him.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That&#8217;s why I believe that to be a good UX researcher / designer is for us to walk the Orwellian path of observation and empathy. When we can dedicate our efforts truthfully, genuinely, in understanding our target users, we will be able to ask the right question, select the proper method, and also conduct it more effortlessly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The question that we can ask ourselves, UX researchers / designers, are: Can we be the next Orwell or Steinbeck?</p>
</div>
